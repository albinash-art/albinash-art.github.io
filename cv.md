**Albina Sharafullina** (b. 1990, Russia)

<p align="justify">Albina Sharafullina is a realist artist, who believes in close consideration of the reality which later helps with altering the reality for coming up with a creative project. It is so difficult to get to very nature of things and people around us, but it shouldnâ€™t discourage us - we should keep looking.</p>
